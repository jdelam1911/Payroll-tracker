## Apology
This assignment was so complicated for me that throughout a week i had barely gotten thru just one part of this, i had a tutor but couldnt make it to finalze my car situation, I studied and looked over countless videos and support. I respectfully take the grade it is that i will recieve for this and for the future try other methods to understand the concepts. Very VERY confusing but i wont stop, and will continue to apply myself.
